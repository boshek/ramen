### Marinade

2 parts water
2 parts rice vingegar
1 part mirin
1 part reduced sodium soy sauce

## Mushrooms
Try to use at least two different types of mushrooms. Enoki and some button-type mushroom works really well. 

### Method
- Mix together enough marinade to cover the amount of mushrooms you have. Bring it to a boil and add the mushrooms for two minutes. 
- Then remove from heat put in the fridge for at least 3 hours (overnight even better)
- Eat cold
